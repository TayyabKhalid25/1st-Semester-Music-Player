Project Title: Audio Player with Spectrum Analyzer and Equalizer

Project Description:
Our Project is a music application that will play common extensions like .mp3 and .wav using already
provided frameworks such as JUCE, IMGUI, BASS and Qt framework. The purpose is to provide a highly
interactive player that will do basic tasks like audio playback, storing files in a playlist, increasing
decreasing the volume, utilizing an audio mixer to change sounds similar to a DJ, etc.

Features:
- Interactive GUI
- Audio player
- Audio Mixer/ Equalizer  // Removed
- Visualizer
- Spectrum Analyzer  // Removed
- Automatic .mp3 and .wav files recognition on system
- Repeat, Repeat once, Shuffle, (Playback modes), etc.
- Playlists

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: C++
- Libraries or Frameworks: JUCE, IMGUI, BASS, Qt framework
- Tools: Visual Studio 2022 IDE and Compiler

Setup and Usage:
Download all files of the application and run the exe file. Browse files for the location of the audio files
on your computer and the program will automatically detect most audio files in the folder and show
them in the application for playing. After opening an audio file, the equalizers can be used to change the
frequency of the music playback and control the audio. Playlists can also be formed and saved on the
application.

Acknowledgements:
The Following videos have given us clarity on the manipulation of audio in C++ along with the
frameworks used for it. We have also thoroughly analyzed their source code and are using it as
inspiration for our project.
